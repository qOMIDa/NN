This is one of the most important side projects!
I'm going to say the minmum characteristics needed:
  - ARCHLINUX or DEBIAN BASED distro          ->  I like the module-like version of the first but I think Debian would be easier
  - FULL 32bit/64bit support!                 ->  Every machine should work
  - Lightweight ISO(s) must be a priority!    ->  A lightweight OS will work in mostly any hardware
  - FULL local installation                   ->  No need for internet
  - FULL office capabilities                  ->  Libreoffice? Openoffice?
  - FULL offline capabilities                 ->  No internet? No worries
  - ROBUST and STABLE                         ->  Self explanatory
  - EXTREME low-energy mode                   ->  Useful for laptops, just the bare minimum cpu clock to work, etc.
  - Multilanguage!                            ->  Self explanatory
  - Granny safe                               ->  A good OS is an intuitive OS
  - Useful for everyday use                   ->  It just need to be versatile
  - Capacity of hosting basic web servers     ->  Despite not being a server, it should have minimum of tools dedicated to it
  - Capacity for self replication             ->  The OS must be able to generate it's own ISO
  - Capacity for making bootable drives       ->  Not only USBs or CDs, but through internet protocols also

Everything can change, and I will be updating this file as more things appear to my mind.
As always, I'm open for any recommendation, feel free to sugest anything.
